    <h1>Wrestling</h1>
    Wrestling is a combat sport that involves two competitors engaging in a physical struggle to gain and maintain control over each other. The primary objective is to either pin the opponent's shoulders to the mat or to score points through various techniques. Wrestling has a rich history and is practiced in various forms worldwide, including folkstyle, freestyle, and Greco-Roman wrestling.

<br>Here are key features and aspects of wrestling:
<ul id="slide-list">
    <li>Objective: The main goal in wrestling is to either pin the opponent by holding both of their shoulders to the mat for a specific duration (usually a few seconds) or to score points through controlled takedowns, throws, and other techniques.</li>

    <li>Weight Classes: Wrestlers compete in specific weight classes to ensure fair competition based on body size and weight. Weight classes vary depending on the style of wrestling and the governing body.</li>

    <li>Takedowns: Wrestlers earn points by executing successful takedowns, where they bring their opponent to the mat while maintaining control. Common takedowns include single-leg and double-leg takedowns.</li>

    <li>Escapes and Reversals: Wrestlers can earn points by escaping from the opponent's control or reversing their position to gain the upper hand.</li>

    <li>Pins and Falls: The ultimate goal in wrestling is to pin the opponent's shoulders to the mat. A pin results in an immediate victory. If a pin does not occur, the match is decided based on points.</li>

    <li>Periods and Rounds: Wrestling matches are typically divided into periods or rounds. The number and duration of periods vary depending on the style of wrestling and the level of competition.</li>

    <li>Mat Control: Wrestlers use various techniques to control their opponent on the mat. This includes maintaining top position, preventing escapes, and avoiding being taken down.</li>

    <li>Folkstyle, Freestyle, and Greco-Roman: There are different styles of wrestling, with folkstyle being predominant in the United States, freestyle being an Olympic discipline, and Greco-Roman focusing on upper-body throws and holds without using the legs for offensive moves.</li>

    <li>Conditioning and Strength: Wrestling requires exceptional physical conditioning, strength, agility, and endurance. Wrestlers engage in intense training to develop these attributes and to prepare for the demands of competition.</li>

    <li>Discipline and Sportsmanship: Wrestling instills values such as discipline, perseverance, and sportsmanship. Wrestlers learn to set and achieve goals, respect opponents, and display dignity in both victory and defeat.</li>

    <li>International Competitions: Wrestling has a strong international presence with competitions such as the World Wrestling Championships and the Olympic Games. Wrestlers from different countries compete at the highest levels to showcase their skills.</li>

    <li>Youth and Collegiate Wrestling: Wrestling is often introduced at the youth level, and many individuals participate in high school and collegiate wrestling programs. Collegiate wrestling, especially in the United States, is a popular and competitive sport.</li>

    <li>Wrestling is not only a challenging sport but also a form of self-defense and a foundation for success in various other combat sports, including mixed martial arts (MMA).</li>
