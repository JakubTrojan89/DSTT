    <h1>Submission Grappling</h1>

Submission grappling is a form of competitive grappling that focuses on the application of joint locks and strangles to force an opponent to submit. Unlike traditional wrestling, which may emphasize pinning an opponent to the mat, submission grappling involves techniques derived from various martial arts, such as Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ), judo, and catch wrestling. The primary objective is to manipulate an opponent's joints or airway to the point where they concede defeat by tapping out.

<br>Here are key features and aspects of submission grappling:
<ul id="slide-list">
    <li>Submissions: Submission grappling is centered around the application of submissions, which can include joint locks like armbars, kimuras, and leg locks, as well as strangles or chokes such as rear naked chokes and guillotines.</li>

    <li>Positional Control: Practitioners aim to gain and maintain advantageous positions on the ground, such as mount, back control, side control, and various guard positions, to set up and apply submissions effectively.</li>

    <li>No Striking: Unlike mixed martial arts (MMA), submission grappling typically prohibits striking techniques. The emphasis is on grappling and submission holds rather than punches, kicks, or other striking maneuvers.</li>

    <li>Gi and No-Gi Formats: Submission grappling can be practiced both with and without the traditional gi (uniform). No-gi grappling usually involves wearing shorts and a rash guard, emphasizing control without the use of the gi for grips.</li>

    <li>Points System: Some submission grappling competitions incorporate a points system to determine winners in the absence of a submission. Points are often awarded for achieving dominant positions and controlling the opponent.</li>

    <li>Tap Out: A tap out is a physical gesture, typically tapping the mat or the opponent, indicating submission. It is a fundamental aspect of submission grappling, allowing practitioners to concede defeat and prevent injury.</li>

    <li>Variety of Styles: Submission grappling draws techniques from various martial arts disciplines, making it diverse and adaptable. Different styles and approaches can be seen based on the background of the practitioner.</li>

    <li>Competitions: There are various submission grappling competitions and tournaments held worldwide, providing opportunities for practitioners to test their skills against others. Prominent events include the ADCC (Abu Dhabi Combat Club) Submission Wrestling World Championship.</li>

    <li>Self-Defense Application: Submission grappling techniques can have practical applications for self-defense, particularly in situations where the confrontation goes to the ground.</li>

    <li>Emphasis on Technique: Skill and technique are paramount in submission grappling. Practitioners often focus on refining their understanding of leverage, body mechanics, and timing to execute submissions effectively.</li>

    <li>Cross-Training: Many martial artists, including those from BJJ, judo, and wrestling, incorporate submission grappling into their training regimen to improve their ground game and overall martial arts skills.</li>
